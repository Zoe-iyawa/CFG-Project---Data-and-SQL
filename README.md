## Code First Girls
I took part in CFG Kickstarter course in Data and SQL which touched feature topics such as 
- Structured Query Language
- Database Management
- Data analysis and Manipulation
- Visualizing data 

## Music Recommendation System
For my final project I was tasked with creating, delivering and presenting a database project. The project can be on any topic of choice, however, it must contain all major learnings from the course such as 
- Creating relational DB
- Primary and Foreign key
- Stored function and Stored procedure
- Joins and Views
- Subquery
- Aggregate Functions

I created a Music Recommendation System. Using a spotify dataset sourced from kaggle, I designed this database to manage spotify extensive library of songs. Made not just for music lovers but for individuals who enjoy a casual song on their bus ride or on a commute to work. its purpose is to suggest personalised albums or tracks to users based on their preferences, track attributes and listening patterns. 

## Dataset
The Dataset for this table was sourced from here (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tonygordonjr/spotify-dataset-2023/data?select=spotify-albums_data_2023.csv). This dataset has been normalized by myself and I have added some unique touches while creating my project.

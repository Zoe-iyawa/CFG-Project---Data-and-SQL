## Music Recommendation System

For my final project I created a Music Recommendation System. Using a spotify dataset sourced from kaggle I designed this database to manage spotify extensive library of songs. Made not just for music lovers but for individuals who enjoy a casual song on their bus ride or on a commute to work. its purpose is to suggest personalised albums or tracks to users based on their preferences, track attributes and listening patterns. 

## Dataset
The Dataset for this table was sourced from here (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tonygordonjr/spotify-dataset-2023/data?select=spotify-albums_data_2023.csv). This dataset has be normalized by myself and I have added some unique touches while creating my project.
